Perfect! Let's add your steps properly into the `README.md` with a nice clean format.  
I'll also make sure to **fix typos**, **make the steps clear**, and **list all required libraries** based on your Flask app.

- Friendly, polite, and professional customer support behavior.
- System prompt ensures consistent, helpful responses.
- Easy to extend or customize.
- No cloud or external APIs required — runs fully offline!

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- Python 3 (Flask)
- Ollama (local LLM server)
- DeepSeek-LLM model
- HTML + JavaScript frontend

## 📋 How to Run DeepSeek R1 Locally for a Chatbot

### 🛠 Step 1: Install Ollama
Ollama is the easiest way to run models like DeepSeek locally.

- Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/) and download/install it for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
- After installing, open a terminal and run:

```bash
ollama run deepseek 
or
ollama run deepseek-llm:latest
```

This command will automatically download and start DeepSeek-LLM.

---

### 🛠 Step 2: Set up Python Environment

Clone this repository and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jesmeen-online/llm-customer-support-chatbot.git
cd llm-customer-service-chatbot

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

---

### 🛠 Step 3: Install Required Python Libraries

Install all necessary libraries for the Flask application:

```bash
pip install flask requests
```

**Required Libraries:**
- Flask — for the web server and API routes
- Requests — for sending HTTP requests to Ollama server

You can also use a `requirements.txt`:

```txt
flask
requests
```

---

### 🛠 Step 4: Run the Flask Chatbot

Start the chatbot server:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

✅ Now you can chat with DeepSeek-LLM locally through a web UI!

---

## 🧠 How it Works
- User sends a message from the browser.
- Flask backend forwards the message to Ollama's `/api/chat` endpoint.
- DeepSeek-LLM processes the input and generates a streamed response.
- The chatbot UI displays the response to the user.

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Live "typing..." animation while bot responds
- Save and export chat history
- Knowledge Base (FAQ) integration
- User authentication (optional)
